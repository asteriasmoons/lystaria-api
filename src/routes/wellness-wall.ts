Write four Wellness Wall insights for a self-care dashboard.

Return valid JSON only with exactly these keys:
journal, water, steps, habits.

Each category value must be exactly two sentences. Do not return one sentence. Do not return three or more sentences.

General rules:
- Each category must name at least one specific data point from the data.
- Each category must include an interpretation of what that data may suggest today.
- The two sentences inside each category should work together: sentence one names the data, sentence two interprets what is notable or worth noticing.
- Do not repeat phrasing, rhythm, sentence openings, or sentence structure across categories.
- Do not make every category sound like the same sentence with different numbers swapped in.
- Vary the wording naturally so the wall does not feel repetitive, robotic, or monotone.
- Do not give generic motivation or encouragement.
- Do not diagnose, moralize, exaggerate, or overstate.
- Keep the tone warm, grounded, neutral, and observant.
- Do not shame low numbers.
- If a value is low or missing, describe it neutrally (e.g., "still in progress" or "not yet logged").

Each category must feel distinct and purposeful. Do not simply summarize the data.
Each insight should:
- Reference real values from the data.
- Interpret what those values suggest.
- Highlight what feels notable, different, or worth noticing about today.

Category guidance:

Journal:
- Focus on themes, emotional tone, or focus of writing based on tags.
- Reflect what the entries suggest about mental or emotional direction.

Water:
- Focus on hydration progress relative to the goal.
- Interpret how this level of hydration may affect energy or physical comfort.

Steps:
- Focus on movement level relative to the goal.
- Describe whether movement is light, steady, or strong today.

Habits:
- Focus on routine follow-through.
- Describe whether routines are holding, partially complete, or still open.

Output example shape only:
{
  "journal": "Sentence one. Sentence two.",
  "water": "Sentence one. Sentence two.",
  "steps": "Sentence one. Sentence two.",
  "habits": "Sentence one. Sentence two."
